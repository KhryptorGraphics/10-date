# Performance Optimization Guidelines for 10-Date

This document outlines performance optimization strategies and best practices for the 10-Date application.

## Web Application Optimizations

### JavaScript Optimizations

1. **Code Splitting**
   - Use dynamic imports for route-based code splitting
   - Lazy load components that are not needed on initial render
   - Use React.lazy() and Suspense for component-level code splitting

2. **Bundle Size Reduction**
   - Use tree shaking to eliminate dead code
   - Analyze bundle size with tools like Webpack Bundle Analyzer
   - Use smaller alternatives for large libraries
   - Consider using micro-frontends for large applications

3. **Rendering Optimizations**
   - Use React.memo for pure functional components
   - Use useCallback for event handlers
   - Use useMemo for expensive calculations
   - Implement virtualization for long lists (react-window, react-virtualized)
   - Avoid unnecessary re-renders with proper state management

4. **State Management**
   - Keep state as local as possible
   - Use context API for shared state
   - Consider using Redux Toolkit for complex state management
   - Normalize state for efficient updates
   - Use selectors to derive data from state

### CSS Optimizations

1. **CSS-in-JS Optimizations**
   - Use static extraction when possible
   - Minimize runtime styles
   - Use atomic CSS-in-JS libraries for better performance
   - Consider using CSS Modules for critical components

2. **Critical CSS**
   - Extract and inline critical CSS
   - Defer non-critical CSS
   - Use media queries to load CSS conditionally
   - Minimize CSS specificity

### Network Optimizations

1. **Resource Loading**
   - Use resource hints (preload, prefetch, preconnect)
   - Implement HTTP/2 for multiplexing
   - Use CDN for static assets
   - Implement proper caching strategies

2. **Image Optimizations**
   - Use responsive images with srcset and sizes
   - Use modern image formats (WebP, AVIF)
   - Implement lazy loading for images
   - Use image compression and optimization tools

3. **API Optimizations**
   - Implement request batching
   - Use GraphQL for data fetching when appropriate
   - Implement proper caching for API responses
   - Use optimistic UI updates

## Mobile Application Optimizations

### React Native Optimizations

1. **Component Optimizations**
   - Use PureComponent or React.memo for pure components
   - Implement shouldComponentUpdate for class components
   - Use FlatList or SectionList for long lists
   - Implement pagination for large datasets

2. **Memory Management**
   - Avoid memory leaks by cleaning up event listeners
   - Use InteractionManager for heavy operations
   - Implement proper image caching
   - Use WeakMap for storing references to objects

3. **Navigation Optimizations**
   - Use native navigation solutions (React Navigation)
   - Implement screen preloading for common navigation paths
   - Use shallow navigation when possible
   - Optimize screen transitions

### Native Module Optimizations

1. **Bridge Optimizations**
   - Minimize bridge crossings
   - Batch bridge communications
   - Use native modules for performance-critical operations
   - Consider using JSI for direct JavaScript-to-Native communication

2. **UI Thread Optimizations**
   - Keep UI thread free for animations and gestures
   - Move heavy computations to background threads
   - Use native driver for animations
   - Implement proper debouncing and throttling

### Asset Optimizations

1. **Image Optimizations**
   - Use appropriate image formats and sizes
   - Implement proper image caching
   - Use image placeholders and progressive loading
   - Consider using vector graphics for icons

2. **Font Optimizations**
   - Limit the number of custom fonts
   - Use font subsets when possible
   - Preload fonts to avoid layout shifts
   - Consider using system fonts for better performance

## Privacy Center Specific Optimizations

### Data Access Panel Optimizations

1. **Data Loading**
   - Implement pagination for export history
   - Use skeleton screens during data loading
   - Implement proper caching for data categories
   - Use optimistic UI updates for better user experience

2. **Export Request Handling**
   - Implement proper request queuing
   - Use background processing for export generation
   - Implement progress indicators for long-running operations
   - Use WebSockets for real-time updates on export status

### Consent Management Panel Optimizations

1. **Consent Data Loading**
   - Implement proper caching for consent preferences
   - Use skeleton screens during data loading
   - Implement optimistic UI updates for toggle switches
   - Batch consent updates when possible

2. **Consent History Optimizations**
   - Implement pagination for consent history
   - Lazy load consent history when needed
   - Use virtualization for long history lists
   - Implement proper filtering and sorting

### Account Management Panel Optimizations

1. **Account Data Loading**
   - Implement proper caching for account information
   - Use skeleton screens during data loading
   - Implement pagination for account activity
   - Use virtualization for long activity lists

2. **Account Operations**
   - Implement proper validation before destructive operations
   - Use background processing for account deletion/anonymization
   - Implement proper error handling and recovery
   - Use optimistic UI updates for better user experience

### Privacy Information Panel Optimizations

1. **Content Loading**
   - Implement lazy loading for tab content
   - Use code splitting for each tab
   - Implement proper caching for static content
   - Use skeleton screens during content loading

2. **Interaction Optimizations**
   - Implement proper debouncing for search inputs
   - Use virtualization for long FAQ lists
   - Optimize animations for tab switching
   - Implement proper keyboard navigation

## Monitoring and Measurement

1. **Performance Metrics**
   - First Contentful Paint (FCP)
   - Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
   - First Input Delay (FID)
   - Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
   - Time to Interactive (TTI)
