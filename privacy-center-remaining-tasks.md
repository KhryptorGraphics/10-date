# Privacy Center - Remaining Implementation Tasks

Based on our implementation plan and the work completed so far, here are the remaining tasks to complete the Privacy Center:

## Frontend Components

All Privacy Center frontend requirements have been fully implemented:

- `AccountManagementPanel.tsx` provides account deletion, anonymization, confirmation, explanations, and user feedback.
- `PrivacyInformationPanel.tsx` includes privacy policy viewer, FAQ, privacy rights, education, and support.
- `routes.tsx` and navigation expose Privacy Center via `/privacy` and from the user profile.
- All major Privacy Center panels (Data Access, Consent, Account Management, Privacy Info) are accessible and tested.

**No outstanding frontend Privacy Center tasks.**

## Mobile App Implementation

### 1. Privacy Center Screen
- Create `PrivacyCenterScreen.tsx` for the mobile app
- Implement tab-based navigation

### 2. Data Access Screen
- Create mobile-optimized version of the Data Access panel
- Implement share functionality for exports

### 3. Consent Management Screen
- Create mobile-optimized version of the Consent Management panel
- Implement simplified consent history view

### 4. Account Management Screen
- Create mobile-optimized version of the Account Management panel
- Implement biometric confirmation for critical actions

### 5. Privacy Information Screen
- Create mobile-optimized version of the Privacy Information panel
- Implement searchable FAQ

## Testing and Refinement

### 1. Unit Tests
- Write unit tests for backend services
- All key frontend Privacy Center panels/components have unit and integration tests.

### 2. Integration Tests
- Write integration tests for API endpoints
- Write end-to-end tests for user flows (web privacy center flows covered)

### 3. Accessibility Review
- Ensure WCAG compliance
- Test with screen readers
- Verify keyboard navigation

### 4. Performance Optimization
- Optimize data loading
- Implement pagination for large datasets
- Add caching where appropriate

### 5. Security Review

- Add tooltips and help text in the UI (UI help present in panels)

### 2. Developer Documentation
- Document API endpoints
- Document component architecture (frontend privacy center structure up to date)
- Create maintenance guide

## Deployment

### 1. Database Migration
- Create and test database migration script
- Plan for zero-downtime deployment

### 2. Feature Flagging
- Implement feature flags for gradual rollout
- Set up A/B testing for UI variations

### 3. Monitoring
- Set up monitoring for privacy-related operations
- Create alerts for suspicious activities

## Timeline
