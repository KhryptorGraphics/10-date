## Introduction

The Privacy Analytics Dashboard is a tool for monitoring and analyzing how users interact with privacy features in the 10-Date mobile app. It provides valuable insights while maintaining strict privacy standards and data anonymization.

### Purpose

- Monitor privacy feature usage to identify areas for improvement
- Track consent changes to understand user preferences
- Analyze data export patterns to optimize the export process
- Measure engagement with privacy information to improve communication
- Identify potential issues with privacy features

### Privacy-First Approach

All analytics data is:
- Anonymized to remove personally identifiable information
- Aggregated to prevent individual user identification
- Collected with user consent
- Subject to retention policies
- Protected with appropriate security measures

## Dashboard Overview

The Privacy Analytics Dashboard is built on Firebase Analytics and provides real-time and historical data about privacy feature usage. It is accessible to authorized team members through a secure web interface.

### Key Features

- Real-time monitoring of privacy feature usage
- Historical trend analysis
- Customizable date ranges
- Data export capabilities
- Role-based access control
- Automated alerts for unusual patterns

## Data Collection

### Data Sources

The dashboard collects data from the following sources:

1. **Privacy Center Screens**: User interactions with Privacy Center screens
2. **Consent Management**: Changes to consent preferences
3. **Data Export**: Requests and completions of data exports
4. **Account Management**: Account deletion and anonymization actions
5. **Privacy Information**: Engagement with privacy policy, FAQs, and rights information

### Collection Mechanism

Data is collected through the `privacy-analytics.service.ts` and sent to Firebase Analytics via the `firebase-analytics.service.ts` integration. The collection process follows these steps:

1. User interacts with a privacy feature
2. The interaction is captured by the privacy analytics service
3. The event is anonymized and sent to Firebase Analytics
4. The dashboard retrieves and displays the aggregated data

### Data Schema

Each analytics event includes:

- Event type (e.g., `privacy_screen_view`, `privacy_consent_changed`)
- Timestamp
- Anonymized session ID
- Device type
- App version
- Event-specific parameters

## Key Metrics

The dashboard tracks the following key metrics:

### Overall Metrics

- **Privacy Center Visits**: Total number of visits to the Privacy Center
- **Average Time Spent**: Average time users spend in the Privacy Center
- **Feature Engagement Rate**: Percentage of users who interact with privacy features
- **Completion Rate**: Percentage of started privacy actions that are completed

### Feature-Specific Metrics

- **Consent Change Rate**: Frequency of consent preference changes
- **Data Export Volume**: Number and size of data exports
- **Account Management Actions**: Frequency of account deletion and anonymization

## Implementation Details

### Technical Architecture

The Privacy Analytics Dashboard is built on the following technologies:

- **Firebase Analytics**: Backend analytics platform
- **React**: Frontend dashboard interface
- **D3.js**: Data visualization library
- **Node.js**: API server for custom analytics processing

### Integration with 10-Date App

The app integrates with the dashboard through:

1. **Privacy Analytics Service**: Captures privacy-related events
2. **Firebase Analytics Service**: Sends events to Firebase
3. **Analytics Configuration**: Controls what data is collected

### Code Examples

#### Event Tracking

```typescript
// In a component
import privacyAnalyticsService from '../services/privacy-analytics.service';

// Track screen view
useEffect(() => {
  privacyAnalyticsService.trackScreenView('PrivacyCenter', 'Main');
}, []);

// Track consent change
const handleConsentChange = (type: string, newValue: boolean) => {
  setConsent(newValue);
  privacyAnalyticsService.trackConsentChanged(type, newValue, !newValue);
};
```

#### Firebase Integration

```typescript
// In firebase-analytics.service.ts
private async logEvent(eventType: PrivacyEventType, params: Record<string, any>): Promise<void> {
  try {
    // Map privacy event type to Firebase event name
    const firebaseEventName = eventTypeMapping[eventType];
    
    // Add timestamp
    const eventParams = {
      ...params,
      timestamp: Date.now(),
    };
    
    // Log event to Firebase
    await firebaseAnalytics.logEvent(firebaseEventName, eventParams);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Error logging Firebase Analytics event ${eventType}:`, error);
  }
}
```

## Privacy Considerations

### Data Anonymization

All data in the dashboard is anonymized to protect user privacy:

- User identifiers are replaced with anonymous session IDs

- Precise location data is not collected
- Personal data from privacy actions is not included in analytics

### Data Retention

Analytics data is subject to the following retention policies:

- Standard retention: 90 days
- Aggregated data: 1 year
- Historical trends: Indefinitely (fully anonymized and aggregated)

### User Consent

Users can control analytics collection through:

- Initial consent during onboarding
- Privacy settings in the app
- Data collection opt-out option

### Compliance

The dashboard is designed to comply with:

- GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
- CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)
- HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
- App Store and Google Play privacy requirements

## Access and Permissions

### User Roles

The dashboard supports the following user roles:

- **Admin**: Full access to all dashboard features and data
- **Analyst**: Access to view and export data, but cannot change settings
- **Privacy Officer**: Special access focused on compliance monitoring
