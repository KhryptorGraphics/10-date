# Backend Architecture - Dating Platform

## Overview
The backend is a **modular monolith** built with **NestJS** and **TypeScript**, designed for scalability, maintainability, and future microservice extraction.

## Technology Stack
- **Node.js** with **TypeScript**
- **NestJS** framework for modular architecture
- **PostgreSQL** as primary database
- **Redis** (optional) for caching, pub/sub, and real-time improvements
- **Socket.IO** or **WebSockets** for real-time messaging
- **JWT** for stateless API authentication
- **OAuth2** integrations (Google, Facebook, Apple)
- **Swagger/OpenAPI** for API documentation

## Module Breakdown
- **Auth Module:** Email/password login, OAuth, JWT issuance, refresh tokens, password recovery
- **User Profiles:** Profile data, images, preferences, interests
- **Matching Engine:** Adaptive AI-based matching, swipe logic, implicit/explicit preferences
- **Messaging:** Real-time encrypted chat, media sharing, message sync
- **Media:** Profile image upload, resizing, storage optimization
- **Payments:** Premium subscription management, payment gateway integration
- **Notifications:** Push notification management, templates, scheduling
- **Admin API:** User/content moderation, analytics, configuration
- **Analytics:** User engagement, revenue, system health metrics

## API Design
- RESTful JSON APIs, versioned (`/api/v1/`)
- JWT-based auth for mobile apps and API calls
- Secure HTTP-only cookies for website sessions
- WebSockets for real-time chat and notifications
- Follows OpenAPI standards, auto-generated docs via Swagger

## Real-time Communication
- Use **Socket.IO** integrated with NestJS Gateway for:
  - Encrypted messaging
  - Typing indicators
  - Read receipts
  - Presence/online status
- Redis Pub/Sub backend for horizontal scalability of real-time features

## Security Considerations
- Argon2 or bcrypt password hashing
- OAuth2 token validation
- HTTPS enforced via Apache2 reverse proxy
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for admin endpoints
- Audit logging for sensitive actions

## Scalability & Maintainability
- Modular codebase with clear separation of concerns
- Can extract modules into microservices if needed
- Horizontal scaling via multiple Node.js instances behind Apache2
- Caching with Redis to reduce DB load
- Asynchronous processing for heavy tasks (e.g., AI matching, image processing)

## Next Steps
- Define detailed API endpoints and request/response schemas
- Implement module scaffolding with NestJS CLI
- Set up database migrations and seed data
- Integrate OAuth providers
- Develop real-time messaging backend
- Write unit and integration tests
