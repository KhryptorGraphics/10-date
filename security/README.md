# Security & Compliance - Dating Platform

## Authentication
- **Email/password login** with Argon2 or bcrypt password hashing
- **OAuth2** integrations:
  - Google, Facebook, Apple ID
  - Store provider IDs linked to user accounts
- **JWT tokens** for stateless API authentication (mobile apps, API calls)
- **Refresh tokens** stored securely, rotated regularly
- **Session cookies** (HTTP-only, Secure, SameSite) for website frontend
- **Password recovery** via email with time-limited, signed reset tokens

## Authorization
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
  - User roles: user, moderator, admin, superadmin
  - Granular permissions for admin panel actions
- **Access control** enforced at API and service layer
- **Audit logging** for sensitive actions (bans, payments, data changes)

## Data Security
- **HTTPS enforced** via Apache2 reverse proxy with TLS certificates
- **Encryption in transit:** TLS 1.2+ for all API and WebSocket traffic
- **Encryption at rest:**
  - Password hashes (Argon2/bcrypt)
  - Sensitive fields (payment info, message blobs) encrypted in DB
  - Encrypted backups
- **Input validation & sanitization** to prevent injection attacks
- **Rate limiting** and **abuse detection** on APIs
- **CSRF protection** for website frontend
- **CORS policies** restricting API access origins

## Privacy & Compliance
- **GDPR** and **CCPA** compliant data handling
- User data export and deletion capabilities
- Consent management for data collection and marketing
- Minimal data retention policies
- Logging and monitoring access to personal data

## Infrastructure Security
- **Firewall** and **network segmentation**
- **SSH key-based access** to servers
- **Regular security updates** and patch management
- **Secrets management** (environment variables, vaults)
- **Monitoring** with alerts for suspicious activity
- **Automated backups** with secure storage

## Third-Party Integrations
- Use **secure SDKs** and **API keys** stored in environment variables
- Validate OAuth tokens with providers
- Secure payment gateway integration (PCI DSS compliant)

## Next Steps
- Implement OAuth flows and JWT/session management
- Set up HTTPS certificates and enforce TLS
- Integrate RBAC and audit logging
- Conduct security audits and penetration testing
- Prepare compliance documentation and user consent flows
